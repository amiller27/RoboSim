# RoboSim

## SteelHacks Project to Simulate and implement Robot algorithms
RoboSim is an extendable software package that makes it easy to test robots and automatons by unifying software testing and hardware implementation. With RoboSim we took our own Mini Sumo robot as an example to implement in software, and drop the code right into the hardware.

##dependencies
